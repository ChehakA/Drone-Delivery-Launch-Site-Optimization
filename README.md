To identify the three best potential launch sites for a drone delivery service, based on the proximity of these sites to Cambridge, MA (zip code 02139). The goal was to determine which zip codes within a 100 km radius of the headquarters had the highest number of orders, so that the drone launch sites could be chosen within these areas. The analysis involved using SQL queries to process geographical data (latitude and longitude) and order information to identify the best locations for launching the drones.
